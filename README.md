"Diversity over Uniformity: Rethinking Representation in Generated Image Detection" CVPR 2026
</p>


🧠 Overview

DoU revisits representation learning for generated image detection and proposes a diversity-driven framework that moves beyond conventional uniform feature constraints.

💡 Key Idea
Instead of enforcing representation uniformity, we explicitly promote cue diversity while preserving robustness and generalization ability.

🔑 Core Components

🧩 CIB — Cue Information Bottleneck

A VAE-style variational bottleneck applied to multi-stage visual cues, encouraging compact and task-relevant representations.

🔄 AFCL — Adaptive Feature Correlation Learning

An explicit inter-cue decorrelation mechanism that promotes diversity across cues.

🖼️ Multi-Stage CLIP Aggregation

Leveraging hierarchical visual representations for robust generated image detection.
